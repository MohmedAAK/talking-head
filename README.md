# talking-head

it was adapted from 3 diffrent model 
1-) Tensorflowtts models-: to create speach from text link:
2-) Thin-Plate Spline Motion Model: to adabpt image to video motion leading to have any motion you want on finil outcome video.
3-) wav2lip model-: to train video on new audio to lip match the audio , hard to train because of lack dataset availabiley(solved)

Although it meant as report , but you can find parts of code useful as kaggle will help you alot with training problem. (please refere to kaggle folder) 

i will enchance the usabilty of this code soon until then i recommend the best part as kaggle for re-use.
